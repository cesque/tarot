            <h2>Why?</h2>

            <p>
                I realised that I wanted a deck-agnostic tarot site where I could look up meanings very quickly. With so many different and wildly varying decks available, I wanted to not force one specific type of artwork, and instead let the user spend more time looking at their own deck!
            </p>

            <p>
                The goal is to allow for full, customisable tarot spreads alongside a powerful learning tool for looking up and learning card meanings.
